/* Description: In this class, we see how a interface use keoword "extends" by extending  other interfaces.
Relationship: Exer13_InterfaceA, Exer13_InterfaceB, Exer13_SubInterface are interfaces 
So basically Exer18_SubInterface inherting all methods/proeprties from Exer18_InterfaceA & Exer18_InterfaceB
when a concrete/abstract class extends this interface(Exer18_SubInterface) - they will inherit all methods/variables from three interfaces. they
are (Exer18_InterfaceA, Exer18_InterfaceB and Exer18_SubInterface).

	// Not sure what to enter in sub interfaces, but you can extend other interfaces like above.
